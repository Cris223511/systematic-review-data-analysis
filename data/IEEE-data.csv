In this paper, an intervention tool based on serious games is designed for children with ASD to train their social communication skills. By avatarizing the autistic child who is undergoing intervention in the game scenarios, they can intuitively see themselves participating in the virtual social communication situations created by the game and produce psychological hints of “I should do or say this under this situation”.

Some of these learning difficulties can be effectively addressed with early interventions. For those with autism, personalized learning programs can be put in place to address learning deficits and ensure success. This paper surveys smart tools and techniques reached in the research to assist autistic patients in learning, analyzes their effectiveness, and highlights their strengths and limitations. The survey shows that many of the proposed solutions utilize robots, augmented reality, and mobile apps derived by machine learning to assist autistic children in developing communication skills and expressing their emotions more effectively. However, most systems were managed by parents who were not good observers or by therapists with less experience. This encourages certain researchers to offer observational support to increase the efficacy of ASD interventions.

Neuroimaging studies have previously highlighted the link between social impairment and brain activity in ASD. This study aims to develop a method for assessing and identifying ASD using a social cognitive game-based paradigm combined with electroencephalo-graphy (EEG) signaling features. Typically developing (TD) participants and autistic preadolescents and teenagers were recruited to participate in a social game while 12-channel EEG signals were recorded. The EEG signals underwent preprocessing to analyze local brain activities, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency features. Additionally, the global brain network’s functional connectivity between brain regions was evaluated using phase-lag indices (PLIs). Subsequently, machine learning models were employed to assess the neurophysiological features. Results indicated pronounced ERP components, particularly the late positive potential (LPP), in parietal regions during social training. Autistic preadolescents and teenagers exhibited lower LPP amplitudes and larger P200 amplitudes compared to TD participants. Reduced theta synchronization was also observed in the ASD group. Aberrant functional connectivity within certain time intervals was noted in the ASD group. Machine learning analysis revealed that support-vector machines achieved a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91.7%, and accuracy of 95.8% as part of the performance evaluation when utilizing ERP and brain oscillation features for ASD characterization. These findings suggest that social interaction difficulties in autism are linked to specific brain activation patterns.

However, existing research mainly focuses on extracting low-level hand-crafted facial features for analysis and classification. Determining how to learn discriminative deep representations from dynamic facial data for computational model construction remains an unresolved challenge. In this study, we propose an ASD recognition model based on facial videos to fill the lack of temporal correlation learning of facial features. First, we utilize a vision transformer to extract frame-based global facial features. Then, we use a Longformer to establish the correlation of facial features over time. In the experiment, we recruited 146 subjects between 2 and 8 years of age to record their facial videos under a computer-based eye-tracking experiment and 76 subjects to conduct a smartphone-based experiment.

Autistic individuals often present difficulties in emotional regulation, emotion recognition and imitation, and in maintaining focus. Emotional expressions and attention are thus hallmarks of ASD and ADHD and can be analyzed to identify these conditions. In this study, we developed and validated a serious game that integrates emotion recognition and attention tracking as a novel tool for identification of ASD and ADHD. Leveraging the TrueDepth camera capabilities, our game provides a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to current face-tracking technologies. We compared the accuracy of emotion recognition using Euclidean distance with calibrated reference expressions and a calibration-free system based on a machine learning model using Random Forest. We also identified children at risk of ADHD using the Bells test and constructed a machine learning model, utilizing Support Vector Machine and Leave-One-Out Cross Validation, trained on attention data and game data to predict this risk. Our game was tested on 20 adults to validate the emotion recognition system, and then on 17 children of the primary school to assess usability and test the constructed models. The emotion recognition system achieved an accuracy of 0.78 for adults and 0.45 for children, while the machine learning model predicted seven emotions in children with an accuracy of 0.50, suggesting the potential for eliminating the need for calibration. The model also obtained good results in predicting valence and arousal values. The attention model showed excellent validation scores (accuracy: 0.94), indicating the possibility of extending it to a larger cohort. The System Usability Score was excellent (85.0), and children found the game enjoyable, making it a promising tool for ASD and ADHD identification.","","979-8-3503-2745-8","10.1109/ACIIW59127.2023.10388145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388145","emotion;attention;autism;ADHD;serious game;machine learning","Support vector machines;Emotion recognition;Autism;Euclidean distance;Predictive models;Regulation;Data models","","1","","34","IEEE","16 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early detection of autism spectrum disorder and its consequences play major role in intervention. Yet it often remains unrecognized and diagnosed in non-clinical environments because of unawareness and the lack of screening tools specific to the autism. At times, autistic children express their feelings through aggressive behaviour towards themselves or other children due to number of reasons such as failing to understand their own feelings, misunderstanding and severe distress. While an autistic child engages in physical aggression, an immediate response is required because the sibling or peer will likely react to the child's aggressive behaviour. There's no systematic approach to identify the pre-aggressive behaviour of autistic children in software engineering perspective. The proposed Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) early signs and pre-aggressive detection system is a software which provides automated solution to aforementioned problems using computer vision and machine learning libraries. It provides a level detection on early signs of autism by analyzing facial features and behaviour patterns in non-clinical perspective.

Prior research has frequently relied on proprietary or small-scale datasets, often limited to digital drawings produced on tablets or smartphones, which may not fully capture the natural characteristics of hand-drawn expression. To address these gaps, we introduce KIDO, a novel publicly available dataset of scanned children’s drawings paired with reflections written by the children on whether their drawings represent happiness or sadness. The dataset contains contributions from 5,430 students, with balanced representation across primary and secondary education levels and additional metadata on gender and educational background. For our experiments, we employed CNN-based and Vision Transformer–based models for emotion recognition, obtaining F1-scores of up to 79.03% from drawings, while BERT-based models achieved accuracies of up to 97.47% in classifying children’s written reflections. We further trained a generative model on the KIDO dataset to synthesize emotionally expressive drawings, with subjective evaluations indicating that children often preferred the AI-generated images to those drawn by their peers. KIDO serves as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing research in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, psychology, and education, and is publicly available at github.com/serdarciftci/KIDO","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3606359","Harran Üniversitesi(grant numbers:22010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11151239","Children’s emotion analysis;classification of children’s drawings;classification of children’s thoughts;KIDO dataset","Pediatrics;Psychology;Feature extraction;Transformers;Machine learning algorithms;Accuracy;Motors;Emotion recognition;Depression;Autism","","","","63","CCBY","4 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
